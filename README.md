# C#

A repo for code in C#, most related to data warehousing, architecture and pipelines. 
In particular, I'm playing around with **ADO.NET** as these set of classes are frequently used in
scripting for automated ETLS.

Find examples of:

1. How to Check for A Excel SheetName using C# 
- Particularly useful when your data pipeline involves a user uploading a excel file and want to avoid the ETL breaking spectacularly because the user has used a sheetname that's different to the expected sheetname in the SSIS ETL .

2. How to Copy a Excel Sheet using C#
- Helpful when you want to maintain naming consistency for excel sheets and avoid breaking an automated ETL.
